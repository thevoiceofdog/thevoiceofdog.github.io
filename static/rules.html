    <li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">We can sometimes accept longer works, though an authorization from a
            reader who intends to cover that story is needed (this can be yourself, as authors are encouraged to, if
            they wish, read their own stories.)</span></li>
    <li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">We cannot accept works that would require more than two sequential
            episodes.</span></li>

            chapter from a novel, provided that excerpt stands on its own as a complete narrative and doesn&rsquo;t
            require the listener to know the rest of the story to make sense.</span></li>
