While waiting for that to land, if you would like more after this one, you can find more of their stories in the anthologies found on their GoodReads profile at goodreads.com/leinir. This story in particular can be found in the FurPlanet anthology Exploring New Places, where a variety of animal people go out and explore a wide variety of new places.Read for you by&nbsp;Khaki, your faithful fireside companion.">
