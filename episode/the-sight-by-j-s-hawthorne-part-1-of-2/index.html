                <meta property="og:description" content="Everyone knows that if you have a supernatural problem in New York City, you pay a visit to David Steward, Private Eye. Not everyone knows the story of Steward’s first case, or how he got the scar over his eye. This is that story, the story of what it takes for a man to leave the comfort of the real world to hunt the things that stalk the five boroughs by night.﻿Tonight’s story is the first of two parts of “The Sight” by J.S. Hawthorne, who probably isn’t a horrible monster lurking in your closet. A proud member of the Furry Historical Fiction Society, J.S.’s work was most recently in “In the Light of the Dawn,” available at fhfs.ink.   ">
