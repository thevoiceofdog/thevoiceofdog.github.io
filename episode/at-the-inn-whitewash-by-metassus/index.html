                <meta property="og:description" content="Inn-keeper Boris's idea to give Brontes the minotaur some useful work leads to an attempted murder and a surprising revelation. This episode is brought to you by the Village Tourism Committee. Come and visit us sometime! Today’s story is “At The Inn—Whitewash” by friend-of-the-fireplace Metassus, featuring the adventures of Brontes, a gruff minotaur who previously appeared in the story “At The Inn”, also featured on The Voice of Dog. Based in the wild west of Ireland, Metassus started writing some time back as part of the "Thursday Prompt" group on Fur Affinity. His work has appeared in the Anthrocon magazine, in Fang Vol. 4, and occasionally on his printer by mistake. He is particularly keen on word-limited micro-fiction, calling them "365 Word Tales". At some point he'll have 365 of them and consider his work on earth done. You can read his writings and view his photography on furaffinity.net, or on metassus.com. Read for you by Khaki, your faithful fireside companion. ">
