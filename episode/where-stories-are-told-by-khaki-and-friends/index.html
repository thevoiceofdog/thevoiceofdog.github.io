                <meta property="og:description" content="I’d like to take a moment to reflect on this last year we’ve shared.One year ago the first story aired on The Voice of Dog. The reality of the pandemic had arrived in my country, and all over the world people were feeling isolated and uncertain and powerless. I started this podcast because I wanted to do something about it —anything, just to make something, anything, better for someone. Anyone.&nbsp;I decided I wanted to tell people stories. Stories that would give them courage, or hope, and if nothing else, something to look forward to. Even if they didn’t listen to the stories, I still wanted people to know that someone cared enough about them to have a new story for them to enjoy, every time they came back.The first was, appropriately, “Bad Dog!” by my friend Rob Baird. A story of unfairness, and powerlessness in the face of power — but also a story of defiance and of hope. Many other writers have contributed stories since then. There’s a name for writers who’ve had stories on this podcast, you know. They’re “Friends of the Fireplace” — in early stories I sometimes mentioned that, though I realized I never explained why, and fell out of the habit.163 stories have appeared on The Voice Of Dog in the last year. 163, by 82 writers — well, 83 now, including me. Today's story is “Where Stories Are Told”, a riff on the traditional Irish masterpiece “The Humours of Whiskey”, by Khaki, your faithful fireside companion, and friends — and I’d like to take a moment to thank them:Rob Baird, for Games at Götterdämmerung, Bad Dog!Televassi, for BlueBucks, Counter-CultureHuskyteer, for The Lion of the Low Countries, The Zeroth Protocol, Once We Were MeerkatsNightEyes DaySpring, for Glory of the Gods, Foxing for Pizza, The Tomb Guardian, Loving You is WrongAltivo Overo, for Rabbit Food, How Menander Got His Name, A Close Port of Call, Beyond Mundane Horizons, Catch Me If You Can, Coyote's Voice, The Blue Eye of the Desert God, Harvest Home, All That Glitters, Gibbous Moon WaningToledo the Horse, for Fuzzy Memory, Returning, SecretDomus Vocis, for Edge of the Universe, Somewhere in the White Void, Hades &amp; Philos: Prelude, Bounty Hunter UncleFrances Pauli, for Rats, The Lion Sleeps, Always TomorrowRyan Campbell, for 6 Unbelievable Facts About Unicorns That Will Completely Blow Your Mind, Eagle's SplendourMary E.
