                <meta property="og:description" content="Over the last year, I’ve been joined by other storytellers who’ve read stories for you here on the podcast. You may remember the name Rob MacWolf — werewolf hitchhiker, who’s recorded 12 episodes and written 14, including a collaboration with another Friend of the Fireplace, as podcast alumni are called.Last Halloween, he produced the “Ghost of Dog” series of stories, and recently curated some romantic episodes from the back catalog. He’s been staunch ally of the podcast and a loyal friend to the community of writers that sprang up around it, so I’m very happy to announce that Rob MacWolf — werewolf hitchhiker will be joining me as co-host of The Voice of Dog.He’ll help with selecting, producing, editing and introducing episodes starting next week, and he’s recently started the podcast’s official Twitter account, @voiceofdogpod, where new episodes are announced with links to the authors and their galleries — and who knows, maybe some other announcements.I’m glad to have Rob aboard, I’m excited to see what fresh ideas he’ll bring to the show, and I hope you’ll join me in wishing him godspeed.&nbsp;  ">
