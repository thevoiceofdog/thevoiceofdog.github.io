The original story is a very straight-forward historical story with no grand or fantastical elements. And while it might make a dry read as a transcription, when you hear it in Tsalagi, from a language speaker, there is a level of emotion and unspoken context that can be felt in the bones. My hopes in adding the narrative beats I did, the big, fantastical elements, the personal perspective, is an attempt to capture the impressions of some of these like you would with an abstract painting. This is a story meant to be read out loud, tasting the syllables and the emotions they carry. They are the bold colors and brushstrokes of the story as it asks you to consider the perspective of the real people that made that journey.

I started this podcast because I wanted to do something about it \u2014anything, just to make <em>something</em>, anything,<em> </em>better for <em>someone</em>. Anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided I wanted to tell people stories. Stories that would give them courage, or hope, and if nothing else, something to look forward to. Even if they didn\u2019t listen to the stories, I still wanted people to know that someone cared enough about them to have a new story for them to enjoy, every time they came back.</p><p>The first was, appropriately, \u201cBad Dog!\u201d by my friend Rob Baird. A story of unfairness, and powerlessness in the face of power \u2014 but also a story of defiance and of hope. Many other writers have contributed stories since then.

It is rising. It is soon.</p><p>Secret scents nocturnal up are swelling, and above</p><p>The moon rolls like a mirror of the face of her I love.</p><p>I will not go outside tonight, will nor unbar the door.</p><p>Much as I love the moon above I love my pillow more.</p><p>Dusk depths deepen, but my quilt is just as deep.</p><p>Tonight will I lie warm beneath the secret seal of sleep.</p><p>Long yards yearning as the night wears on:</p><p>A room becomes a furlong after the light is gone.</p><p>Strong ways winding on familiar hills</p><p>All still to be discovered. When the fire chills</p><p>The ashes seem the silver streak across the open plain</p><p>When green is gone and blue is gone and black and white remain.</p><p>Sweet grass sweating out a liquid cold.</p><p>Close clothes fretting, but my will will hold.</p><p>Though out upon the mountains I have gone questing oft,</p><p>My eyes are very weary and my bed is very soft.</p><p>The midnight wind is bracing as a wine of molten red:</p><p>I have no need of either. I am already in bed.</p><p>Silence sits as even as summer sifted sand,</p><p>Peace, forgetfulness, and bliss are all within my hand,</p><p>When drifts a wandering whistle across the fluid night,</p><p>Its tone is very heavy, its voice is very light.</p><p>It carries, calls, and choruses from engine cloud to me.</p><p>It rings the glassy silver rails that lead down to the sea.</p><p>It howls and harmonizes with the songs of yesterday</p><p>That also echoed off the moon. And sleep is far away.</p><p>The train is gone, the whistle fades. She will have heard it too.</p><p>I am already doing it: I know what I must do.</p><p>Tall trees rustling as I unlock the door</p><p>Where every night I thrill to think I may return no more.</p><p>Wild wind whispers of the wildest paths we trod</p><p>Where in moonshadows darkly we may see the face of God.</p><p>Brisk breeze bracing on my heavy hanging tongue.</p><p>Sward is soft between my toes, the blades are new and young.</p><p>Scant breath skitters across my shivering skin.</p><p>The leaves smell sweet around me and savory within.</p><p>Cold clouds clearing as the moon sails on.</p><p>It lights the open threshold, I am already gone.</p><p>Wind wakes wildly and ruffles up my fur:</p><p>I think I\u2019ll go outside tonight, and take a walk with her.</p>",

His work has appeared in the Anthrocon magazine, in Fang Vol. 4, and occasionally on his printer by mistake. He is particularly keen on word-limited micro-fiction, calling them \"365 Word Tales\".
