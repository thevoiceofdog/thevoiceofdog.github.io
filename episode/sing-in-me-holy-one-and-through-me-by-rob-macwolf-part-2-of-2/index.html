They know not its love.Today’s story is the second and final part of “Sing in Me, Holy One, and Through Me” by Rob MacWolf, who heard it on the wind but couldn’t say where the wind got it. You can find more of his work in anthologies from the Furry Historical Fiction Society, and on his SoFurry gallery.Read by the author.

Whenever the stranger sings, anyone within earshot can be compelled to sing with him, even though what they sing is incomprehensible, sometimes with—as in the case of Rafe Rogers, local hired ruffian—psychoanihilatory results. What this coyote wants, and indeed what he is, remains unknown.  ">
