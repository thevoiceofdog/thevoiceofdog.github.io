                <meta property="og:description" content="When she decided to clean her anniversary gift properly—for once—a mother has a flashback to her own childhood, and links the good times of the past to the good times of the present, and to her own mate and cubs. A tender tale of family and delicate glassware. Today’s story is “Crystal” by friend of the fireplace Metassus. Based in the wild west of Ireland, Metassus started writing some time back as part of the "Thursday Prompt" group on Fur Affinity. His work has appeared in the Anthrocon magazine, in Fang Vol. 4, and occasionally on his printer by mistake. He is particularly keen on word-limited micro-fiction, calling them "365 Word Tales". At some point he'll have 365 of them and consider his work on earth done. You can read his writings and view his photography on furaffinity.net, or on metassus.com. Read for you by Khaki, your faithful fireside companion. ">
