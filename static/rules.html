                from a reader who intends to cover that story is needed (this can be yourself, as authors are encouraged
                to, if they wish, read their own stories.)</span></li>
        <li class="c0 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">We cannot accept works that would require more than two
                sequential episodes.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">We may consider accepting an excerpt from a longer work, such as
                a chapter from a novel, provided that excerpt stands on its own as a complete narrative and
                doesn&rsquo;t require the listener to know the rest of the story to make sense.</span></li>

                coordinate with a reader, or to submit a reading yourself, if you wish to submit a non-English work, and
                we will need to discuss with someone fluent in that language that the work otherwise meets our
                requirements.</span></li>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is permitted and encouraged to submit multiple works, with the understanding that
            we try not to broadcast consecutive works by the same author. If you were to submit ten stories at once you

            encouraged to discuss and collaborate with a reader if they wish, but </span><span class="c5">a finished
            reading shall be accepted as-is</span><span class="c1">. Neither we nor submitting authors may require
