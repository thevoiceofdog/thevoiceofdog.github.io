                <meta property="og:description" content="Today’s story is “A Day With the Skaraks” by C.F. Becker, a 3D artist whose work can be found on FurAffinity under the name CannonFodder. As you can guess from the name, his work explores themes of war and the soldiers who fight it, but such a broad subject captures ideas from all across the fandom. This story is an example of that depth. The story was originally written as an accompaniment to a four page, full-color, textless comic drawn by the talented furry artist Samareck. The comic can be found on FurAffinity and on Samareck’s website at DeviantArt. Read for you by Khaki, your faithful fireside companion. ">
